# TAC
Therion's Archive Converter, the original from the 90's

This was the version submitted to Virtual Pascal what seems a lifetime ago. I was asked to remove any reference to them, so yup, that's me - decades later.

It compiles cleanly with VP/2 - if you are daring enough you can prove me wrong. Of course, it would be easy to modify for any Windows or WhateverNIX purposes, and i did have a few attempts at that, however, question is if it is really useful in present day. I *did* semi-successfully make a 32 bit Windows version of it much later, however, is there a need for it?

I simply cannot find the original documentation, nor the source for TACSETUP, so i uploaded the last config file i used myself, and you will have to figure out the rest yourselves.
